# ML-project2-text-classification

This project aims at making supervised binary classification of tweets according to the emotion given by this phrase. These tweets initially contained positive smiley ”:)” or negative smiley ”:(”. These emojis has been removed from the tweets and the tweets has been labeled according to the emoji removed.

In this repository you can find all the files summarising our exploratory work to get the best accuracy on our prediction. 

### preprocessing-pipeline.ipynb

First, in this notebook, we have made an explanatory study of the data to better understand them. We also evaluated the most appropriate preprocessing methods to use in order to best prepare the data for model training and prediction. We also placed all the useful definitions on preprocessing in the python file f_preprocessing.py` so that they can be used in other notebooks.
